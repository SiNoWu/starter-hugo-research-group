Research interests
The main focus of this systems biology lab to identify genes and/or microbial species that are of clinical significance by computational methods and multi-omics data integration, and develop novel methods to manipulate them for the purpose of real-life applications.

The lab is currently working on the following three topics:

gut- and intra-tumor- microbiota and their association with disease progression and impact on treatment
genetic modification of bacteria and phages for the purpose of drug delivery, cancer treatment and diagnosis
gut virome (phage and human viruses) profiling and association with diseases
They require both tool development and applications. 

The lab is mostly computational, with close collaborations with experimental microbiologists, clinicians, hospitals and even entrepreneurs.
